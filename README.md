# Holy-Scale-M4L

I wanted to get into Max For Live, so I wanted to find a project to start with.  
What I decided was I was going to re-make the "Holy Scale" Ableton Live racks that were created by 8bitbandit.

## Changes

Originally I wanted to make a single max for live device that would let you change the keys, and switch between major and minor.  
I also had some aspirations to add to it by adding in inversions and whatnot. I quickly found that there were some limitations
to max for live and in the end I don't think I'll be able to carry out my dream.  
That being said, I improved on the original racks in the sense that I was able to combine all major keys into one device,
and all minor keys into one device, thus making the total number of devices, two.

## Future Updates

I will try and squash any bugs that may arise and release updates that fix them. I don't know if I have any plans to expand on this
further, but if anybody has any good ideas on functions I may be able to add then I'm all ears. I would definitely love to expand
on this further.

## Thanks

I want to thank 8bitbandit for creating the original Holy Scale racks in the first place. Without them I would have not been able 
to compose some of my favourite original tracks. The tools helped me immensely. I also want to thank him for going through the trouble
of figuring out all the semi tone intervals for all the chords, I definitely would have been too lazy to figure them all out.
